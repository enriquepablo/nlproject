= Requirements

Python-2.5 - http://www.python.org
pyclips - http://pyclips.sourceforge.net/web/

= Installation instructions.

To just use the system, you can use setuptools to install nl from Pypi. However, due to some bug in pyclips' setup.py, pyclips hasto be installed by hand. Sometimes easy_install pyclips works, sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't, follow instructions in http://pyclips.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pyclips/pyclips/trunk/README?view=markup&pathrev=297. Once you have pyclips in your python environment, issue:

$ easy_install nl

If you want nl's development environment, you can use buildout. In this case pyclips is installed by buildout.

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/enriquepablo/nl/
$ cd nl
$ python2.5 bootstrap.py
$ bin/buildout
$ bin/test
$ bin/ipython


= POSSIBLE PROBLEMS

For some reason, sometimes the pyclips library doesn't get installed properly through setuptools. Then the only option is to download pyclips from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyclips/files/ and install it according to its own instructions.
