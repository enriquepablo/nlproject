Python-2.5

= Installation instructions.

To just use the system, you can use setuptools to install it from Pypi:

$ easy_install nl

If you want to run the tests and hack at it, you can use buildout:

$ hg clone https://enriquepablo@bitbucket.org/enriquepablo/nl/
$ cd nl
$ python bootstrap.py
$ bin/buildout
$ bin/test
$ bin/ipython

Of course, you can always just grab the nl package from the repository and put it somewhere in your python path.
