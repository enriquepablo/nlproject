Perhaps the most similar project to nl that I have found on the Internet is the Semantic Web's OWL specifications and implementations. Obviously the similarity does not lay in their conception or intent, that in the case of the semantic web is introducing order into the web's actual content, and in the case of nl is producing a general programming tool.
